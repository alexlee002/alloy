  "description": "\n    ASIHTTPRequest is an easy to use wrapper around the CFNetwork API that\n    makes some of the more tedious aspects of communicating with web servers\n    easier. It is written in Objective-C and works in both Mac OS X and iPhone\n    applications.\n\n    It is suitable performing basic HTTP requests and interacting with\n    REST-based services (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE). The included\n    ASIFormDataRequest subclass makes it easy to submit POST data and files\n    using multipart/form-data.\n\n    Please note that ASIHTTPRequest is not recommended for newer projects \n    since it's not actively maintained anymore. \n    For more info visit: http://allseeing-i.com/%5Brequest_release%5D\n  ",
